### 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Nima.

🌇  I’m a New York'er at heart who was born in Khartoum, Sudan and has developed a passion for decentralization and renewable energy technology. I am currently based in Los Angeles, California. 

💻  I started to learn to code 6 years ago while pursuing a Computer Science degree at Community College. Since then, I've worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of organizations in my coding journey that have taught me skills like Android Development, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. 

👩🏾‍💻  Today, I'm working as a Software Engineer with the amazing team at Hlgn, Inc, and am getting into blockchain development on my own time. I'm currently learning more about Web 3.0 through Learn Web 3.0 DAO, Alchemy's #RoadToWeb3 Course, Buildspaces awesome tutorials, and many other resources! :-)   

🏔  In my free time, you can find me dabbling in Web 3.0 projects, creating passive income streams, reselling items found at auctions and thrift stores, and teaching others how to attain financial freedom! I also spend my time instructing other woman and minority youth to consider careers in STEM & teach them how to code at non-profit organizations.

💪🏽  Some of my skills include Android Development, Project Management, Product Design, UI/UX Interfaces, and Graphic Design. I am also fluent in the Arabic language. 

👋🏽  Feel free to reach out to chat! I love meeting new people & collaborating as well. Looking forward to buidling. WAGMI !!!!
